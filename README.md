# xxz_spinchain
A simulator for different types of Heisenberg XXZ spin chains with spin 1/2-particles written in python.

# Introduction
This is the simulation written for my bachelor thesis. General physics description can be found in bsc.pdf (To be inserted!). A technical description of the code will be provided in the future. 
This code is intended to serve as a introduction to spin chain simulations and might be not the fastest code to simulate the dynamics of such a quantum system. However it is easy to extend the code with needed functions or add it to a parallel cluster setup. 

# Code structure
The main code is defined in three python-files (to be inserted ), which bring basic functionality. The simulation are written with Jupyter Notebooks. However all notebooks, analysing the dynamics of a system, share the same general setup, which is introduced in a basic.ipynb (to be inserted!). Other example notebooks will be uploaded after some code cleanup. In the end all notebooks used to produce the results from bsc.pdf will be published in this repository.
